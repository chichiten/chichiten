## Hi, I'm Chiiki!

I'm a MERN stack developer and a web designer. I'm passionate about creating beautiful, functional websites and applications that are a pleasure to use. My expertise lies in building modern and responsive web applications leveraging the power of JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my dogs, playing video games, and exploring the great outdoors.

I'm excited to be part of the open source community and look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with others.
